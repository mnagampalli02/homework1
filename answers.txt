What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Rebase essentially moves the whol;e nranch to a new base coomit and as a result rewrites the commit history.
This makes the history look more linear and cleaner. Merging essentially sticks to the commit history 
while combining the changes from one branch to another.
